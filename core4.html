	<dt style="color:blue;"><b>Conditionals</b></dt>
    <dd>- A conditional is an ‘if, then’ statement, where if one thing happens in a program, it could trigger a specific line of code. If that condition is not met, then a different line of code may be activated as a result.</dd>
    <dd>- For example, if you choose to go to go to work you earn money as a result. However, if you choose not to work, you earn no money.</dd>
    <dt style="color:blue;"><b>Variables</b></dt>
    <dd>- Variables are elements that are stored within code and are often determined by outsider information.</dd>
    <dd>- For example, a game may ask for a user's name, and once inputted the game will substitute that name into the game for future reference.</dd>
    <dt style="color:blue;"><b>Functions</b></dt>
    <dd>- Functions are the process pf performing certain tasks, similar to math equations. It is when a certain action or term is defined by a line of code.</dd> 
    <dd>- For example, in math, a variable such as "y" may be represented by the equation "y = mx + b". Similarly, a function in a game such as "jumping" could be defined by it's own equation, a line of code.</dd>
    <dt style="color:blue;"><b>Loops</b></dt>
    <dd>- Loops are used to repeat actions in lines of code.</dd>
    <dd>- An example of a common loop used in everyday life can be seen when listening to one's playlist. Often, when we listen to music we can play certain songs "on repeat". You can choose to repeat songs once, twice or until you tell it to stop. In coding, you can repeat certain lines of coding to repeat functions in a similar fashion. Lines of code may be repeated a certain amount of times or for forever if desired.</dd>
